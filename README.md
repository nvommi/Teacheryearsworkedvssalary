# Teacheryearsworkedvssalary
The problem I sought to tackle was determining how specifically the demographic of teachers are grouped regarding years worked and salary. I wanted to do a cluster analysis to understand if there were grouping of teachers that worked in Baltimore based on their Gross salary, annual salary, and years worked.

# Background Statistics
[Article On Teacher Happiness](https://www.baltimoresun.com/education/bs-md-teacher-turnover-20190903-fk72wh2w4vbcfiyxwprhdxzvzy-story.html)
This article basically stated that teachers in Maryland, even specifically baltimore city have been fleeing the occupation for more "prestigious" well paying jobs, which sparked my interest on seeing wheteher or not there were groupings of these "unhappy" teachers. 
[Average Salary for Teachers](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/baltimore-teacher-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IM63_KO10,17.htm)
This article stated that the average salary was around $33k-57k so I kept this in mind while conducting my analysis. 
[Years Worked For Teacher](https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/who-average-us-teacher)
This link also said that the average teacher worked about 14 years with about 53 hours worked.
# Data Question and Business Question
**Data Question: How much does an average teacher make and how long do they work?
How do the cluster points compare to averages overall?
What are 3 anchor points that can illustrate the potential groupings of teachers?
**

**This led me to my business question, "How can one group teachers based on their years worked and salary?"**

# Data Results

After filtering my data, standardizing it, finding the averages and standard deviations, I was able to run a cluster analysis. I found 3 main cluster anchor points which the data seemed to group around. These were at,
~14 years and 30k (113)
~35 years and 38k (25)
~42 years and 36k (92)

Looking strictly at the graphs and values given, it seems as though the data appears to have a slight positive correlation, with the salaries increasing as years worked increases. Although I cannot specifically comment on the correlation, as the number of years increase, some salaries can also see increase. The average years in the city, annual salary, and gross pay are as follows:
28.38 years, $48,405.65, $51,626.16



1. For the 113 cluster anchor point, the years in the city is above average, the annual salary is below average, and the gross pay is below average.
2. For the 25 cluster anchor point, the years in the city is above average, the annual salary is below average, and the gross pay is below average.
3. For the 92 cluster anchor point, the years in the city is below average, the annual salary is below average, and the gross pay is below average.

# Conclusions
While viewing the results, its interesting to observe that many of the salaries are below average which can be attributed to a few high outliers scatterd throughout the data. Since the demographic observed was only teachers in the Baltimore area, it would be interesting to compare this data to other cities with a higher average income or standard of living to see if the clusters would fall in different areas. Further data to analyze would be what area of Baltimore these teachers are from, and if the area that they work in has a lower income causing a lower salary. 
From my findings I can observe that many teachers work from around 14-44 years and earn anywhere from 30-38k. These findings can be used in practice to understand what grouping a teacher will end up in based on the number of years worked. My analysis can be applied to helping a state or local government understand the conditions that teachers face in their working environment. Further analysis on their area would be needed to help the government improve the earning and reduce the years worked to achieve a proper earning.
